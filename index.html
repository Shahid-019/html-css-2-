       <div class="disc"> <p> Founded in 2019 by visionary rapper Playboi Carti, Opium (often stylized as 00pium) is more than just a record label—it is an Atlanta-based movement dominating the underground rap scene. Known for its dark, gritty, and avant-garde "rage" aesthetic, the label brings together artists like ken Carson , Destroy Lonely  , and Homixide Gang to redefine modern hip-hop. Influenced by 70s and 80s punk rock, the Opium aesthetic—characterized by all-black outfits, avant-garde silhouettes, and gothic punk elements—has created a dedicated cult-like following that transcends music, reshaping contemporary pop culture. </p>  </div>

        <div class="p2"> Playboi Carti, born Jordan Terrell Carter, founded Opium in 2019 as a platform to cultivate a unique sound and aesthetic that diverged from mainstream hip-hop. The label quickly gained traction with the release of Carti's sophomore album "Whole Lotta Red," which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Opium's formation was driven by Carti's desire to create a collective that embraced experimental music and fashion, fostering a community of artists who shared his vision for pushing boundaries in both sound and style.</div>
